## Key Achievements

1. **Simplified Visual Interface**: Clean, color-coded nodes with universal connections
2. **Advanced Selection**: Multi-selection with keyboard shortcuts and bulk operations
3. **Group Management**: Full API integration for reusable component groups
4. **Adobe Spectrum Migration**: Consistent design system across graph builder
5. **LLM Judge Testing**: Redesigned test system for AI evaluation
6. **Integrated Workspace**: Unified editing, testing, and graph building experience

## TODO Items
- ✅ Migrate Builder components to GraphBuilder components
- ✅ Simplify node interface in graph builder mode
- ✅ Allow nodes to connect to each other universally
- ✅ Fix edit component drawer in graph builder mode
- ✅ Integrate component editor and test drawer as side panels
- ✅ Implement conversational session support for graph workflows
- ✅ Click node to open edit panel directly
- ✅ Hover-to-add functionality on node handles
- ✅ Persist component grouping to backend DB

## Future Considerations
- Design data structures for component → test suite → test cases
- Live-rendering and centering similar to Dify
- Enhanced graph validation and error visualization
- Performance optimizations for large graphs
